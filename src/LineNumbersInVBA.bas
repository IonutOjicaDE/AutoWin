'You can make calls like this :
'
'Sub AddLineNumbers_vbLabelColon()
'    AddLineNumbers wbName:="EvaluateCall.xlsm", vbCompName:="ModLineNumbers_testDest", LabelType:=vbLabelColon, AddLineNumbersToEmptyLines:=True, AddLineNumbersToEndOfProc:=True, Scope:=vbScopeAllProc
'End Sub
'
'Sub AddLineNumbers_vbLabelTab()
'    AddLineNumbers wbName:="EvaluateCall.xlsm", vbCompName:="ModLineNumbers_testDest", LabelType:=vbLabelTab, AddLineNumbersToEmptyLines:=True, AddLineNumbersToEndOfProc:=True, Scope:=vbScopeAllProc
'End Sub
'
'Sub RemoveLineNumbers_vbLabelColon()
'    RemoveLineNumbers wbName:="EvaluateCall.xlsm", vbCompName:="ModLineNumbers_testDest", LabelType:=vbLabelColon
'End Sub
'
'Sub RemoveLineNumbers_vbLabelTab()
'    RemoveLineNumbers wbName:="EvaluateCall.xlsm", vbCompName:="ModLineNumbers_testDest", LabelType:=vbLabelTab
'End Sub
'
'And as a reminder, here as some compile rules about line numbers:
'
'not allowed before a Sub/Function declaration statement
'not allowed outside of a proc
'not allowed on a line following a line continuation character "_" (underscore)
'not allowed to have more than one label/line number per code line ~~> Existing labels other than line numbers must be tested otherwise a compile error will occur trying to force a line number.
'not allowed to use characters that already have a special VBA meaning ~~> Allowed characters are [a-Z], [0-9], é, è, ô, ù, €, £, § and even ":" alone !
'compiler will trim any space before a label ~~> So if there is a label, the first char of the line is the first char of the label, it cannot be a space.
'appending a line number with a colon will result in having a space inserted between the ":" and the fist next char if there is none
'when appending a line number with a tab/space, there must be at least one space between the last digit and the first next char, compiler won't add it as it does for a label with a colon separator
'the .ReplaceLine method will overide the compile rules without displaying any compile error as it does in design mode when selecting a new line or when manually relaunching compilation
'the compiler is 'quicker than the VBA environment/system': for example, just after a line number with colon and without any space has been inserted with .ReplaceLine, if the .Lines property is called to get the new string, the space (between the colon character and the first character of the string) is already appended in that string !
'it is not possible to enter debug mode after a .ReplaceLine has been called (from within or outside the module it is editting), not till the code is running, and execution reset.
